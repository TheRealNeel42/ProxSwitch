# ProxSwitch

ProxSwitch is a Firefox only webextension that can be used to quickly add a list of proxy servers and switch from one proxy to another.
I created it to more quickly switch between different tools such as Burp or OWASP ZAP while keeping both running. 

## Installation

I only use this extension locally, so to install simply download the repository, then add it as a temporary extension.
Instructions on how to do this can easily be found online.  
There are currently no plans to publish this extension as it is fairly rough.  

## Usage

Once installed add the friendly name of and url of the proxy server, and click connect.
